Hackathon Notes

Installing Ionic:

Installing MongoDB:
-> ls -lh /usr/local
-> sudo mkdir /usr/local/Frameworks
->  sudo chown $(whoami):admin /usr/local/Frameworks
-> brew install mongodb

Hosting the App/Site:
-> Start locally on Mac/iOS

Using MongoDB:
-> brew services start mongodb
-> db.collection.insert({"abc":"123"})
-> db.collection.find({})
-> db.createCollection("log", { capped : true, size : 5242880, max : 5000 } )
-> db.log.insert({"":"12"})

Be able to interact with it from the actual hosted server
ionic serve
/Users/cebook/anaconda3/bin/todo/www/index.html
change that file to change the ionic server output

brew install node
mkdir myproject
cd myproject/
npm init
npm install mongodb --save
What you put is stored in package.json

For insert a document need to hear back from the Front End what type of information we will be getting exactly


mongod --dbpath=/data
Create a new app.js
modify the file with the function and calling them
thats how you put the data into the database
node app.js


make sure it runs on https
configuration to do so no one can cannot your endpoint
all data will be encrypted from front end to your service
on mongodb you can encrypt the db itself patient details and store the keys separately in safe location
Have a look at mungodb restrictions
So when you call from application needs credentials to database
Check how to set up credentials or securely configure mongodb

Can run on express server
Whatever you can run javascript on the node module
Javacrispt ran on the backend


npm install mongoose --save
nod


------
mongo




*Questions to prepare for judges (JP Morgan Ideology):
How close implementation to the challenge
Two guys coming in
Fit for challenge
Evaluate on the tech and how fit
Is it maintaineble extend, widely used readily updated and why did you choose it
How did you get it done
Test how scalable it is can you extend it easily
How you save data the tech you use
Complexity of solution
Why these technologies, why mongodb light wieight, not familiar with other databases, adjacent use
Why ionic top 10 in 2018
Widely used highly maintained not something niche which no one has heard of
Want to know what people contributed too and how we function as a team
Natural leaders and team dynamics highlighted
Different things we work on a come together as a team
Can show log files
Is the data safe patient, proof of concept important to amazon cloud then we would add that encryption which is very easy on any of these frameworks (https key)
What if I go to town and loose internet connection should still work
What are the next steps for the project how to integrate it looking for how can this actually be used or shit
Concrete plan to move it to production
What would you have implemented if you had more time
Know what we are using
How did you divide the work
Draft presentation at like 7am
Coding stops at 12!
