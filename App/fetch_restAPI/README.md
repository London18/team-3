# This folder contains the scripts to connect the front end with the database


### Client side
Front end HTML calls functions in fetch.js
fetch.js uses fetch to create http call
HTTP call is made to rest API


### Server side
HTTP call is picked up by rest API (index.js)
index.js processes HTTP call
Mongoose is then used to talk to the MongoDB
